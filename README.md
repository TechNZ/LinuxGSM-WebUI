# LinuxGSM-WebUI
Web UI for LinuxGSM - initially purely internal
Im not good at writing readme's and this code was never to see the light of day.
lets see how this goes.

this system make use of the SQL structure that ProFTPD uses for MySQL authentication.
i suggest you make use of this functionality in order to allow yout users to keep FTP and web ui in sync.

the code is written in basic php using a mysql database for storage, and a little bit of bash magic to pull it all together.

more readme to come once i remove some of the more private configuration section from the project and upload it.
